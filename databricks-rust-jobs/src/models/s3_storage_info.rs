Use the [Secrets API](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/secrets.html) to manage secrets in the [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/index.html). Use the [Secrets utility](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-utils.html#dbutils-secrets) to reference secrets in notebooks and jobs.
