Use the [Secrets API](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/secrets.html) to manage secrets in the [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/index.html). Use the [Secrets utility](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-utils.html#dbutils-secrets) to reference secrets in notebooks and jobs.

/// LibraryInstallStatus : * `PENDING`: No action has yet been taken to install the library. This state should be very short lived. * `RESOLVING`: Metadata necessary to install the library is being retrieved from the provided repository. For Jar, Egg, and Whl libraries, this step is a no-op. * `INSTALLING`: The library is actively being installed, either by adding resources to Spark or executing system commands inside the Spark nodes. * `INSTALLED`: The library has been successfully instally. * `SKIPPED`: Installation on a Databricks Runtime 7.0 or above cluster was skipped due to Scala version incompatibility. * `FAILED`: Some step in installation failed. More information can be found in the messages field. * `UNINSTALL_ON_RESTART`: The library has been marked for removal. Libraries can be removed only when clusters are restarted, so libraries that enter this state remains until the cluster is restarted.
