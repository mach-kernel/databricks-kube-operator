For example, if this field is set to 50, and the cluster needs a new `r3.xlarge` spot instance, then the bid price is half of the price of on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. Similarly, if this field is set to 200, the bid price is twice the price of on-demand `r3.xlarge` instances. If not specified, the default value is 100. When spot instances are requested for this cluster, only spot instances whose bid price percentage matches this field will be considered. Note that, for safety, we enforce this field to be no more than 10000.  The default value and documentation here should be kept consistent with CommonConfdefaultSpotBidPricePercent and CommonConf.maxSpotBidPricePercent.
