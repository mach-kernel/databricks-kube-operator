**etag** | **String** | etag used for versioning. The response is at least as fresh as the eTag provided. This is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous writes of a setting overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read -> update pattern to perform setting updates in order to avoid race conditions. That is, get an etag from a GET request, and pass it with the PATCH request to identify the setting version you are updating.  |
